## Feature: User Authentication via Guild Wars 2 API Key

**Status:** üìÖ Planned (v0.1)

### Problem Solved

Traditional account systems add friction and maintenance overhead. By leveraging the official Guild Wars 2 API, players authenticate instantly without passwords or signin.

### Solution Overview

Players authenticate using their GW2 API key. The backend validates it via the official `/v2/account` endpoint, and the player's account ID & name is stored in DB & browser(JWT).

### User Flow

1. Player navigates to the Login page
2. Enters their GW2 API key (requires `account`. `characters`, `builds` scope) `https://wiki.guildwars2.com/images/d/dd/API_Key_Creation.png`
3. Backend validates the key against `https://api.guildwars2.com/v2/account`
4. On success, userid and name is stored in DB and JWT in Clint's browser
5. user can now create, edit their own posts
6. Logout clears the stored credentials from there browser

### Technical Implementation

- **Backend:** Go endpoint `/login` validates keys and returns `{ username, jwt }`
1. Validate GW2 API key via `/v2/tokeninfo` (requires `account`, `characters`, `builds` scopes)
2. Fetch account data from `/v2/account`
3. Create/fetch user by `account.id`
4. Generate JWT with `{ user_id, username }`
5. Return `{ user, token }` (never store API key)
Middleware validates the token and sets the authenticated user context.
- **Frontend:** HTTP ony cookie for jwt and user info
- **External API:** Guild Wars 2 official API (`/v2/account`)
- **Security:** No passwords or the api key stored server-side

### Acceptance Criteria

- [‚úÖ] Valid API keys create user and return JWT
- [‚úÖ] Invalid keys show error message

### Roadmap

- **Next Steps:**
  - Frontend validation for key scope before submission
  - Server-side caching of verified usernames

### Contributing

Help wanted:
- UI feedback improvements for failed login attempts
- Type-safe TypeScript interfaces for GW2 API responses
